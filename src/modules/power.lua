  -- some 80,000 tons of material to orbit, making the cost of energy from such a system vastly more expensive than even
  -- present day nuclear plants. Some technologists speculate that this may change in the distant future if an off-world
  -- industrial base were to be developed that could manufacture solar power satellites out of asteroids or lunar material,
  -- or if radical new space launch technologies other than rocketry should become available in the future.

  -- TODO: (Based on above). What this means is we should implement some kind of Offworld Rocket Silo. Allowing things to be
  -- launched far cheaper. An obvious middle-stage is reusable rockets. A space platform launcher can be effectively
  -- zero-gee and is nearly as cheap as cargo catapult.
