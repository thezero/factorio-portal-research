  -- be cool to require *some* sort of ground-based structures that actually coordinate and track all the orbital activity and even portals, and requiring more computers the
  -- more stuff you have in the air. Mainframes should have a neighbour bonus like nuke plants due to parallel processing, and require use of heat pipes and coolant to keep within
  -- operational temperature. Going too hot e.g. 200C causes a shutdown and a long reboot process only once temperature comes back under 100C.
  -- Mainframes could also interact with observatories to track things better, and/or make orbitals generally work quicker, avoid damage, etc etc.
  -- (Note: mainframe buildable without space science, need them around from the start ... even before the first satellite ... should also make satellites do things! (Map reveal?))
