GUIs conntinually recreating when box open. Pick buttons not working, is this because of that?
Limit boxes to 1 slot
Transmitters not switching between targets. Obvious when wearing equip on asteroid.
Allow switching send/receive of chests and retargetting easily
Portals drawing wayyy too much power on asteroids.
Show current site details
Yes/no on home
Use radio trans for comms
Some sites had resources=nil, need to migrate and count
Icon order, accum. and solar panel are no longer next to each other
Microwave recipes use too many accumulators (maybe, do the math) ... batteries instead?
porrtals need comms system? poss not
RANDOM LOCKING UP
portals not being consumed when deployed
gui close buttons
open portal gui when nearby / teleporting
flickering sometimes when hover an entity
shortcut F to open entity info
why are some chests not teleporting
emergency teleport when no portal = pick any nearest one we can find
allow naming things
tone down heat consumption of plastic forming


  Some general ideas/todos:

  * Environmental conditions on asteroids.
    - Different day/night cycle
    - No wind but is there anything to affect?
    - No burners allowed in atmosphere. (Unless some crazy atmosphericc bubble constructed)
    - No clouds :(  (seems ok at night tho)
  * Orbital research lab
    - Initially deploys with 1000(?) of each science pack (a separate science pack bundle recipe)
    - Needs deliveries of additional science bundles over time as they are consumed
    - Must receive power (microwave)?
  * Space platform / space elevator
    - Shuttle system to move goods between offworld sites
    - Elevator to move goods between ground and space
  * More detailed simulation of offworld activity
    - Time taken for e.g. landers to reach asteroids (scaling with time)
    - Orbital map, danger of orbit collisions (reduced with research), control heights/speeds of orbit
    - Degradation over time due to micrometeors, solar flares, general weathering
    - Send up repair drones
    - Some research to reduce damage from micrometeors etc. (defense system)
    - Mainframes to help with this, also observatories/telescopes


  * Mainframes generally needed to manage data IO
    - Maps crackling with static when not enough CPU power and/or satellites
  * teletrains! personal teleport. phase ammo.
  * Portal destruction planner. portal bulk move, orbital factory deployment...
